We developed a custom AI pipeline in Python to generate learning content, which was stored in AWS S3 and then pulled into the game backend to be converted into playable missions. The game tracks player actions using a custom analytics system, allowing us to make data-driven content recommendations. Math problems are rendered using LaTeX, and we built an internal review dashboard to manage and approve AI-generated LaTeX outputs before they appear in-game.`,

Starting from a fork of an open-source Next.js ChatGPT app, I integrated it with an OpenAI Agent that referenced uploaded PDF documents. The goal was to allow users to query elevator safety codes conversationally. While functional, the tool revealed limitations in current LLMs, as responses were occasionally inaccurate or fabricated even when instructed not to.`,

        "Built a hybrid web and Unity-based LMS that lets teachers create and manage curriculum, import classes from Google Classroom, and deliver interactive lessons through multiplayer Unity games. Teachers could assign quizzes embedded in games like obstacle courses or racing challenges. The Unity platform supported real-time multiplayer via Photon, allowing students to interact with peers and see their teacher in a live video feed inside the game. Teachers controlled the game environment directly from the web app, enabling full classroom management without entering the game.",
